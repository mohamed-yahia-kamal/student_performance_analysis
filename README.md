# 📊 Student Performance Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing student academic performance using Python.  
The main goal is to explore exam score distributions, compare performance across different groups, and extract meaningful insights using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

This project demonstrates my ability to work with real datasets, clean and analyze data, visualize patterns, and communicate insights clearly.
